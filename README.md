machine_learning
================
## Artificial Intelligence

* Search algorithms for Pacman (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*)
* Multi-agents Pacman (Reflex, Minimax, AlphaBeta, Expectimax, Evaluation function)

## Machine Learning

* Theory of learning: error bound, bias-variance, simulation experiments, overfitting, regularization
* Linear model: perceptron, linear/logistic regression, nonlinear transform
* Other models: bagged tree, adaboost with decision dump
